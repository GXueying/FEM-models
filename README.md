README: Stata Code for Health and Healthcare Outcomes Analysis

1. System Requirements

Software Dependencies

Stata (version 15 or later recommended)

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

Tested Versions

Stata 17.0 (macOS Monterey)

Hardware Requirements

Minimum: 4GB RAM, 2GHz processor

Recommended: 8GB RAM or higher for large datasets

2. Installation Guide

Instructions

Ensure Stata is installed and licensed.

Place the dataset files (MEC.dta, SLAS.dta, and WiSE.dta) in your working directory.

Set the working directory in Stata:

cd "path/to/directory"

Load each dataset before running the respective models.

Typical Install Time

Stata installation: ~5-10 minutes

Setting up the dataset: ~1 minute

3. Demo

Instructions to Run on Data

Run the following command in Stata to load and execute models on the MEC.dta dataset:

Expected Output

Coefficient estimates, standard errors, and statistical significance for each probit regression model.

Expected Run Time

Probit models: ~5-10 seconds per model

GLM models: ~15-20 seconds per model

Full script execution: ~2-5 minutes

4. Instructions for Use

Running the Software on Your Data

Replace the dataset file names with your dataset.

Ensure variables in your dataset match the expected variable names.

Modify regression models as needed.

Reproduction Instructions

To reproduce all quantitative results from the manuscript:

Load each dataset sequentially using the use command.

Run the regression models as provided in the script.

Use eststo and margins commands for marginal effects estimation.

This README provides all necessary steps to install, run, and reproduce the analyses included in the study.
